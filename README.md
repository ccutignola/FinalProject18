I created a Connect 4 game for my Final Project. It is a two player game that allows each player to drop their piece in a 4x4 grid. The fucntions run in a while loop that
will run until someone has won. The code will check for the combinations of 1,1,1,1 or 2,2,2,2 vertically, horizontally, or diaganolly. This code does not allow you to pick a column
outside the range of 4 and you cannot insert a piece into a column that is already full. When a player has won, the loop will break and tell the user who has won.
